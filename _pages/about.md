I am Fangkai Jiao(焦方锴), a second-year Master student at Shandong University, mentored by [Dr. Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/). I received my bachelor degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University in 2019.

My primary research interest includes machine reading comprehension and question answering, especially those need multiple reasoning skills.

I interned at CoAI Lab, Tsinghua University, mentored by [Dr. Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml/publications/) from Oct. 2018 to Aug. 2019. I was also an internship at DAMO Academy, Alibaba-inc from Jul. 2020 to Feb. 2021, mentored by Dr. Feng Ji and Dr. Feng-Lin Li.
