I am Fangkai Jiao(焦方锴), a firse-year Master student at Shandong University, mentored by [Dr. Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/). I received my bachelor degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University.

My primary research interest includes machine reading comprehension and question answering, especially those need multiple reasoning skills.

I interned at CoAI Lab, Tsinghua University, mentored by [Dr. Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml/publications/) from Oct. 2018 to Aug. 2019. I am currently an internship at DAMO Academy, Alibaba-inc.
